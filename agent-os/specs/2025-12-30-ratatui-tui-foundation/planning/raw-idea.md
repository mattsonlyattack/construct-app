# Raw Idea: Ratatui TUI Foundation

**Roadmap Item #30: Ratatui TUI foundation**

Description from roadmap: "Build terminal UI scaffold using ratatui with basic layout (note list, detail view, search input)"

This is part of a Rust CLI application called "cons" - a structure-last personal knowledge management tool. The TUI will be an alternative interface to the existing CLI, reusing the same NoteService business logic layer.
