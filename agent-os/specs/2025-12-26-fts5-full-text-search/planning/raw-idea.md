# Raw Idea

**Roadmap Item 15**: Full-text search with FTS5 -- Implement SQLite FTS5 virtual table for content search, with `cons search "query"` command

This is for a Rust CLI tool called "cons" - a personal knowledge management system. The feature adds full-text search capabilities using SQLite's FTS5 extension.
